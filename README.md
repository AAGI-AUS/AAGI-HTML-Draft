# AAGI HTML Draft

This package (repository) enables users to generate HTML reports for analytics projects as part of the AAGI initiative. After installing the package from GitHub, dynamic and reproducible reports can be rendered locally, compliant with AAGI templating guidelines. This repository is intended as a working draft for a report template designed to integrate with the AAGITemplates package from the AAGI-AUS repository. (https://github.com/AAGI-AUS/AAGITemplates)

## Install instructions

Install this R package on RStudio with:

```r
if(!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes") 
remotes::install_github("AAGI-AUS/AAGI-HTML-Draft", upgrade = FALSE)
```

Once this has been installed, we can find the template added onto RStudio. The name of the package is *AAGIHTML* and this can be found under File --> New File --> RMarkdown --> From Template
